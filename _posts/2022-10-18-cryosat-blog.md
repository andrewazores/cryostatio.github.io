Hello, readers!

There is a new option by default for Custom Flight Recording creation. When manually capturing a new recording, it is possible to select if it is going to be "Continuous" or with a fixed duration of time. For recordings with a defined duration, keep the "Archive On Stop" option checked and the recording will be automatically archived when it finishes the capture.

Enter the recording name, template and the capture duration. Keep the "Archive On Stop" option selected.

The recording state will change from RUNNING to STOPPED.

The recording saved will be listed in the Archived Recording tab.
