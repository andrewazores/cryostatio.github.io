Hello, readers!

There is a new option by default for Custom Flight Recording creation. When manually capturing a new recording, it is possible to select if it is going to be "Continuous" or with a fixed duration of time.  For recordings with a defined duration, keep the "Archive On Stop" option checked and the recording will be automatically archived when it finishes the capture.

I hope you find this new option helpful and if you have any suggestions, comments, questions or want to contribute, feel free to connect with us on [Github](https://github.com/cryostatio).
